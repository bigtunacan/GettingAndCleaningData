## Project Description
Create a tidy data set for the John Hopkins Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project based off the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset from the UniversitÃ  degli Studi di Genova.  

##Study design and data processing

###Collection of the raw data

The following information on the original data comes directly from the README.txt of HAR Smartphones Dataset data from Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto

> The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a          smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to  label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.                                                  
>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
> The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has   gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz     cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

###Notes on the original (raw) data 

The original raw data was spread across activity_labels.txt, features.txt as well as a split of test/train data that is spread across label, set, and subject data (X _ (train | test).txt, Y _ (train | test).txt, and subject _ (train | test).txt) 

##Creating the tidy datafile

###Guide to create the tidy data file
The run_analysis.R code file will download and unzip the zipped dataset from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip if it is not already in the relative ./data directory to the project.

###Cleaning of the data
The data from the train and test sets are horizontally merged back together using rbind then the x,y, and subject data sets are vertically merged using cbind.

Human readable activity labels were merged by matching on the activity_id using the data from activity_labels.txt.

Columns that would not be used were removed to tidy the data using grep and then renamed to be more human friendly.

##Description of the variables in the tiny_data.txt file
 - Dimensions of the dataset: 180x68
 - Summary of the data
   - Subject/Activity mean of the merged dataset
 - Variables present in the dataset

(you can easily use Rcode for this, just load the dataset and provide the information directly form the tidy data file)
